## Chapter 2 - Digitalisation of the Finance function "transactional" processes

1. General objectives of digitalisation projects
2. Main process digitalisation : T&E, S2P / P2P, R2R (dematerialisation, automatization, robotisation)
3. Technology (Saas, ERP, "off-the-shelf" products, RPA tools)
4. Implementing those projects, a winning solution

### Chapter 2.1. General objectives of digitalisation projects   

- Cost reduction of finance transactional processing, improved profitability
- Improvement of quality of service to users:
  - responsiveness (real-time)
  - accessibility (anywhere anytime)
  - user-friendly (interface taylored to each user)   
- [ Reduction of low added value tasks]    

A unique Opportunity to offer more responsive, available, and user-friendly finance tools

Detail flowchart above for your organisation. What’s the degree of Digital maturity of your « Expense report process  » : your guess, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (futuristic) ?

----

###### Expense report process digitalisation, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (futuristic)

1. 100% paper based
2. Online form with supporting documents in pdf
3. OCR (optical character recognition) on smartphone, form created within seconds, VAT extract, proof registration
4. Expense form validation without human intervention (check policies, agenda, CRM, T&E ...)

----

###### Objectives of T&E digitalisation project

- Reducing processing costs (expense processing: 15€ to 53€ per form) 
- Improving service quality to users, both managers and employees = responsive, user-friendly, accessible
- Reducing routine tasks (VAT extraction)   

----

###### Complexitiy of implementing a T&E digitalisation project ? 

- Low-cost « off the shelf »  applications 
- Simplicity of integration on increasingly opened IT / ERP systems 
- Legislative framework « digital friendly » 
- « Self-trained » users and relative acceptability
- Resistance to change : not too much of an issue (with few exeptions)    
*T&E Softwares e.g. : [Jenji](https://jenji.io/en), [KDS](https://www.kds.fr/), [Traveldoo for T&E](https://www.traveldoo.com/)*

> **Case example SANOFI (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)**   

- T&E product deployment
- End-to-end approach inclusing Self Booking Tool, complete expense dematerialisaiton, fraud detection, OCR & machine learning, chatbot 
- Integration with HR & finance systems  
- Result : 100 countries, 100 000 users, 1 million expenses/year, an apps elected 2nd prefered apps by employees on our intranet portal.

----

#### S2P Source to Pay / P2P Procure-to-Pay Process     

<img src="images/p2p1.jpg" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"/>

----

- Products usually include dematerialisation functionalities, OCR, supplier portal (improves supplier's information, facilitates supplier management)
- Relative ease of interface with ERP system (invoice and payment information)    
*S2P, P2P Softwares e.g. : [ESKER](https://www.esker.co.uk/), [BASWARE](https://www.basware.com/en-gb), [Tradeshift](https://tradeshift.com/), [Ivalua](https://fr.ivalua.com/)    
*Specifics may be develooped as well (RPA...)*

----

> **Case example EIFFAGE “OPERIS” (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)**   

- Digitalisation of finance function + SSC in France. 
- Innnovative technologies (Tradeshift, Ivalua, Traveldoo), process harmonisation, RPA to increase productivity. 
- Result : demat 2.4 millions of invoices, excellent adoption by operations, productivity +60%.

----

#### R2R Record to Report Process (Financial close & bank reconciliation automatization)    

- Needs clear and coordinated processes
- Organisational impacts      

*R2R Software e.g. : [Blackline](https://www.blackline.com/)*

----

> Case example SODEXO (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)   

- Implementation of Blackline in 4 months to manage closing, bank reconciliation, accounts justification and accounting entries on top of ERPs
- Objectives : improve compliance, real-time collaboration of teams, closing process visibility
- Result : harmonisation of closing process over the group

----

### Chapter 2.3. Technology (Saas, ERP, "off-the-shelf" products, RPA tools)

----

#### Clear on Saas and the like?

Usual apps run more & more in Saas mode (Software as a service, or Cloud app services).
Saas mode replace the "on-premise" architecture, based on a Software hosted within the company's facilities.
"Partial" cloudisaiton can also be implemented with Paas (Platform as a sercie) or Iaas (Infrastrucutre as a service). 
See [IaaS, PaaS, SaaS Explained and Compared](https://apprenda.com/library/paas/iaas-paas-saas-explained-compared/)     

*From an accounting perspective, Saas has implications as it shifts CAPEX towards OPEX*

----

#### Clear on what's an ERP ?
ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) = a group of interconnected modules + a database.

[see here for ERP fundamentals](https://www.oracle.com/applications/erp/what-is-erp.html)

[and here for a neat video to summarize the transversal role of an ERP](https://videos.cdn.sap.com/vod/2017/delivering-on-the-promise.mp4)

[and here to discover your digital finance journey with Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/assets/digibook/erp-cloudjourney/index.html?src=RoadmapTYP&elq_mid=94867&sh=&cmid=WWMK160606P00031C0004)

<img src="images/erp3.png" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"/>     

----

A vast number of ERP products (hundreds if not housands). 
Three leaders, concentrating 50% of th emarket:
- SAP
- ORACLE
- Miscroft Dynamics    

[see more](http://www.businessnsoftware.com/erp-market-share/)

----

#### Off-the-shelf products 
A number of "products" handle automatisation of transactional processes:
- ERP module implementation (SAP, Oracle, MS Dynamics…)
- Market-leading specific business applications, taylored to a specific process (e.g. Blackline for accounting). Those apps can be integrated into increasingly opened IT / ERP systems   

*Include and/or can be "leveraged" with specific add-ons (RPA or Dataviz for example)*

----

#### RPA Robotic Process Automation

A robot automates human tasks, it works ideally if : 
- very repetitive tasks
- no intelligence

Number of available softwares availlable to do so, relative ease of configuration. ROI very dependent of repetitivity.

----

- A 3 minutes, neat & finance related video on an example of RPA implementation = [RPA 3min](https://youtu.be/xW95yb6J1eU)
- Another one in 7 minutes = [RPA 7min](https://youtu.be/loOR-nz9DGY)
- By the way, do you see social issue or social promise in those ?
- OK for reading ? A great tutorial, 20 minutes read : [RPA doc](https://www.guru99.com/robotic-process-automation-tutorial.html)
- Want more ? [RPA for dummies download](https://www.nice.com/websites/rpa/assets/robotic_process_automation_for_dummies.pdf)

### Chapter 2.4. Implementing those projects, a winning solution

----

#### Process digitalisation complexity : sucess is a combination of people, processes, tools

- **People**. Right execution team. "Self-trained" users. Relative acceptability.    

- **Processes**. Digitalisation project supports Process formalisation, clarificaiton, analysis and mapping.
 
- **Tools / technical isues**. Right technical solution for the need. Low-cost « off the shelf » apps. Simplicity of integration on increasingly opened IT / ERP systems.
