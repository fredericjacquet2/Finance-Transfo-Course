### Soft skills

What soft skills are required for the changing role of finance ? 
Broadly speaking, it's around communication and agility, and I'll leave this up to you to think about.  

Two stereotypes to describe the changing role :
- From number cruncher to story teller ?
- From stability to change ? (devops wall of confusion)

### Project Management: waterfall & V-cycle

- Waterfall Model : linear sequential flow through the phases of project implementation.

- V-cycle is an extension of the waterfall model : process steps are bent downwards & upwards with coding at the center.

### Project Management: Risk management

### SCRUM / Agile project management

What's the main diffrence with Waterfall / V-cycle ?   
**The user (the client) participes to the project development cycle - no tunnel effect**
What's, in my opinion, the real added value of agile methodologies (like SCRUM) ?
**SCRUM translated informal best practices into a formal methodology : inspiring values, renamed roles and fancy ceremonies**

##### Agile Manifesto:

----

- USER STORIES (what the client/user wants) rather than functional specifications
- SCRUM MASTER rather than project manager  
- PRODUCT OWNER rather than client representative
- STAND-UP MEETING (no seats, 2 min each, goal oriented = what I did / what I will do / what issues) rather than weekly/daily point
- SPRINT (a set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed) rather then sub-project / set of tasks

----

- deliverables are demo based (avoids the "almost done" syndrom)
- retrospective and continuous improvement (what worked, what not, and what could be improved)
- and even "technical breakfast" as part of the methodology, and much more ...

### Change Management

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. *Charles Darwin*

----

#### Understand the resistance to change / the change cycle

#### 

Greatest expectation for people is to participate to change implementation, in a co-construction mode.  
Finance, transverse business patner, is in the best position to federate the change, in a co-construction mode

Two means to deploy change : 
- By dedicated teams ( internal team or external consultant) and relies on techniques (instrumental driving and / or agile driving)
- Driven by management (managerial change management)

#### Change becomes a daily managerial practice, in a process of tranversal co-construction

### Technical / technology skills

- broad culture ?
- specific know-how ?
- How much do you need to know?
- How long does it take to learn? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zatL4uFRpC0
- Adapt to your role and to your implementation choices
