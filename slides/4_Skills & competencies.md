## Chapter 4 - Skills & competencies

In this chapter :
- Soft skills
- Project Management skills 
- Change Management skills
- Technology : how much do you need to know ?

### Soft skills

What soft skills are required for the changing role of finance ? 
Broadly speaking, it's around communication and agility, and I'll leave this up to you to think about.  

Two questioning stereotypes to debate about this changing role :
- From number cruncher to story teller ?
- From stability to agility ?

### Project Management: waterfall & V-cycle

- Waterfall Model : linear sequential flow through the phases of project implementation.

*Read more:[Wiki waterfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)*

----

- V-cycle is an extension of the waterfall model : process steps are bent downwards & upwards with coding at the center.

### Project Management: Risk management

### SCRUM / Agile project management

----

- Agile/SCRUM, main diffrence with Waterfall / V-cycle:      
**The user (the client) participes to the project development cycle - no tunnel effect**    
.    

- Agile/SCRUM, a real added value:      
**SCRUM translated informal best practices into a formal methodology : inspiring values, renamed roles and fancy ceremonies**

----

##### Agile Manifesto:

----

- USER STORIES (what the client/user wants) rather than functional specifications
- SCRUM MASTER rather than project manager  
- PRODUCT OWNER rather than client representative
- STAND-UP MEETING (no seats, 2 min each, goal oriented = what I did / what I will do / what issues) rather than weekly/daily point
- SPRINT (a set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed) rather then sub-project / set of tasks
- Deliverables are demo based (avoids the "almost done" syndrom)
- Retrospective and continuous improvement (what worked, what not, and what could be improved)
- And even "technical breakfast" as part of the methodology, and much more ...

### Change Management

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.    
*Charles Darwin*

#### Understand the resistance to change / the change cycle

----

The greatest expectation for people is to participate to change implementation, in a co-construction mode.  
Finance, transverse business patner, is in the best position to federate this change in co-construction mode

Change needs to be support by two vectors : 
- Dedicated teams, whether internal or external consultants (it then develops a number of techniques based on instrumental and / or agile driving)
- Management driven (managerial change management)

#### Change management has to become a daily managerial practice, in a process of tranversal co-construction

----

### Technical / technology skills

- How much do you need to know? Broad culture ? Specific know-how ?
- Well ... How long does it take to learn ?  [so fast?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zatL4uFRpC0) If not, adapt your knowledge to your role and to your implementation needs/choices.
- A broad technical understanding may be usefull though (refer to "Technology & Solutions" chapter).
- Cherry-picking can be rewarding (example : learning how to use Power BI for fancy dataviz or an RPA software product).
