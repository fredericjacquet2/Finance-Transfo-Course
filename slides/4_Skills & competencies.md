### Soft skills

What soft skills are required for the changing role of finance ? 
I'll leave this up to you to think about

Two stereotypes to describe the changing role :
- From number cruncher to story teller ?
- From stability to change ? (devops wall of confusion)

----

### Project Management

Waterfall & V-cycle
Risk management

----

### SCRUM / Agile project management

What's the main principle?
The user (the client) is there all the time - no tunnel effect

----

Agility (SCRUM) : very interesting culture even if you do not develop ! 

- Scrum in 10 minutes https://youtu.be/XU0llRltyFM

Agility well "packaged", with principles, rules, and even ceremonies:
- sprint : set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed
- coding dojo (a kind of handson workshop)
- stand-up meeting (2 min each, 15 min overall, no seating ! )
- demo (avoids the "almost done")
- retrospective (what worked, what not, and what could be improved)
- and even "technical breakfast" !

### Change Management

Charles Darwin

----

Greatest expectation for people = participate to change implementation, in a co-construction mode.  

Finance, transverse business patner = in the best position to federate the change, in a co-construction mode

The change deployment: 
- By dedicated teams ( internal team or external consultant) and relies on techniques (instrumental driving and / or agile driving)
- Driven by management (managerial change management)

----

Change becomes a daily managerial practice, in a process of tranversal co-construction
