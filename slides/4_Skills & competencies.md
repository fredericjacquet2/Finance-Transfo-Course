### Soft skills

What soft skills are required for the changing role of finance ? 
Broadly speaking, it's around communication and agility, and I'll leave this up to you to think about.  

Two stereotypes to describe the changing role :
- From number cruncher to story teller ?
- From stability to change ? (devops wall of confusion)

### Project Management: waterfall & V-cycle

- Waterfall Model : linear sequential flow through the phases of project implementation.

- V-cycle is an extension of the waterfall model : process steps are bent downwards & upwards with coding at the center.

### SCRUM / Agile project management

What's the main diffrence form Waterfall / V-cycle ?   

**The user (the client) is alongside the project development, all the time - no tunnel effect**

What's, in my opinion, the real added value of agile methods like SCRUM ?

**SCRUM translated informal best practices into a formal methodology : inspiring values, renamed roles and fancy ceremonies**

----

SCRUM, more than a methodology, a way of life : interesting, even if you are not a software developer !

----

- from functional specifications to USER STORIES (what the client/user wants)
- from project manager to SCRUM MASTER
- from client representative to PRODUCT OWNER
- from weekly/daily point to STAND-UP MEETING (no seats, 2 min each, goal oriented = what I did / what I will do / what issues)
- from sub-project/tasks to SPRINT (a set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed)

----

- deliverables are demo based (avoids the "almost done" syndrom)
- retrospective and continuous improvement (what worked, what not, and what could be improved)
- and even "technical breakfast" as part of the methodology, and much more ...

### Change Management

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change. *Charles Darwin*

> If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got. *Henry Ford*

Understand the resistance to change

----

Greatest expectation for people = participate to change implementation, in a co-construction mode.  

Finance, transverse business patner = in the best position to federate the change, in a co-construction mode

The change deployment: 
- By dedicated teams ( internal team or external consultant) and relies on techniques (instrumental driving and / or agile driving)
- Driven by management (managerial change management)

----

Change becomes a daily managerial practice, in a process of tranversal co-construction

### Technical / technology 

- broad culture ?
- specific know-how ?
- How much do you need to know?
- How long does it take to learn? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zatL4uFRpC0
- Adapt to your role and to your implementation choices
