## Chapter 2 - Digitalisation of the Finance function "transactional" processes

1. Introduciton : general objectives of digitalisation projects
2. Main process digitalisaiton : T&E, S2P / P2P, R2R (dematerialisation + automatization / robotisation)
3. Technology (Saas, ERP, "off-the-shelf" products, RPA tools to further ease digitalisation)
4. Conclusion : implementing those projects, a winning solution

##### Expense report process digitalisation, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (futuristic)

1. 100% paper based
2. Online form with supporting documents in pdf
3. OCR (optical character recognition) on smartphone, form created within seconds, VAT extract, proof registration
4. Expense form validation without human intervention (check policies, agenda, CRM, T&E ...)

### 5. Process digitalisation complexity : sucess is a combination of people, processes, tools

- **People** : execution team skills & stakeholder adoption

- **Processes** : well defined & well applied !

- **Tools / technical isues** : the right technical solution for the need

*See more in chapter 6 (Implementation)*

### Conclusion   

**Digitalisation of existing processes** 
- dematerialization (including OCR) 
- automatisation/robotisation (simplify process management & remove low-added value tasks)
