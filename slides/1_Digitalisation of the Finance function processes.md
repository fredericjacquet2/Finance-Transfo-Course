## Chapter 1 - Digitalisation of the Finance function processes

- An example : expense process digitalisation
- Objectives & complexity of process digitalisation projects
- Processes to be digitalised:
  - T&E, S2P, P2P, R2R (dematerialisation + automatization / robotisation)
  - Reporting, cost control & Performance management (data analysis and datavisulisation)

### An example to start with : digitalising the expense report process

What’s  the degree of Digital maturity of your « Expense report process  » : your guess, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (futuristic) ?

##### Expense report process digitalisation, on a scale of 1 (poor) to 4 (futuristic)

1. 100% paper based
2. Online form with supporting documents in pdf
3. OCR (optical character recognition) on smartphone, form created within seconds, VAT extract, proof registration
4. Expense form validation without human intervention (check policies, agenda, CRM, T&E ...)

##### Objectives of an Expense report digitaliation project

- Reducing processing costs (expense processing: 15€ to 53€ per form) 
- Improving service quality to users, both managers and employees = responsive, user-friendly, accessible
- Reducing routine tasks (VAT extraction)   

----

##### Complexitiy of implementing an Expense report digitalisation project ? 

- Low-cost « off the shelf »  applications 
- Simplicity of integration on increasingly opened IT / ERP systems 
- Legislative framework « digital friendly » 
- « Self-trained » users and relative acceptability
- Resistance to change : not too much of an issue (with few exeptions)    
*T&E Softwares e.g. : [Jenji](https://jenji.io/en), [KDS](https://www.kds.fr/), [Traveldoo for T&E](https://www.traveldoo.com/)*

> **Case example SANOFI (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)**   

- T&E product deployment
- End-to-end approach inclusing Self Booking Tool, complete expense dematerialisaiton, fraud detection, OCR & machine learning, chatbot 
- Integration with HR & finance systems  
- Result : 100 countries, 100 000 users, 1 million expenses/year, an apps elected 2nd prefered apps by employees on our intranet portal.

----

#### General objectives of digitalisation projects   
- Cost reduction of processing
- Improvement of quality of service to users = responsiveness (real-time), accessibility (anywhere anytime), user-friendly (interface taylored to each user)
- [ Reduction of low added value tasks] 

----

##### Complex ? Sucess is a combination of tools, processes, people    

**Tools / technical isues**    
- Market-leading software applications
- Simplified integration (opened, « IT backbone » ERP)

**Processes**    
- Well defined & applied

**People**    
- Implementation team skills (soft & hard)
- Users training if needed
- General resistance to change : indivudual and organisational
- Organisational & social issue

### What processes can be digitalised ? A few examples

----

##### S2P Source to Pay / P2P Procure-to-Pay     

<img src="images/p2p1.jpg" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"/>

- Products usually include dematerialisation functionalities, OCR, supplier portal
- Relative ease of interface with ERP system (invoice and payment information)    
*S2P, P2P Softwares e.g. : [ESKER](https://www.esker.co.uk/), [BASWARE](https://www.basware.com/en-gb), [Tradeshift](https://tradeshift.com/), [Ivalua](https://fr.ivalua.com/)    
*Specifics may be develooped as well (RPA...)*

----

> **Case example EIFFAGE “OPERIS” (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)**   

- Digitalisation of finance function + SSC in France. 
- Innnovative technologies (Tradeshift, Ivalua, Traveldoo), process harmonisation, RPA to increase productivity. 
- Result : demat 2.4 millions of invoices, excellent adoption by operations, productivity +60%.

----

##### R2R Record to Report / Financial close & bank reconciliation automatization    

- Needs clear and coordinated processes
- Organisational impacts      
*R2R Software e.g. : [Blackline](https://www.blackline.com/)
----

> Case example SODEXO (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)   

- Implementation of Blackline in 4 months to manage closing, bank reconciliation, accounts justification and accounting entries on top of ERPs
- Objectives : improve compliance, real-time collaboration of teams, closing process visibility
- Result : harmonisation of closing process over the group

----

##### Reporting, cost control & Performance management 

- Data extraction & analytics to provide ad-hoc reporting, with data taylored to various users needs
- Datavisualisation = customed extraction & presentation, tailored to user needs    

*Specific solutions based on BI (Business Intelligence) and EPM Enterprise Performance Management softwares*

----

> Case example IPSEN « FIT Finance Ipsen Transformation » (source Digital Finance Awards 2019)

- Digital dashboards = reporting tool, real-time, anywhere (PC/mobile/tablet), fit-for-purpose (adapts to each user), interactive & fancy (graphs & drill down) to check sales, costs, P&L on a given perimeter.
- Result : lower solicitation of cost control on support presentations, better appropriation of the financial data by operations.

----

### Conclusion   

Digitalisation of existing processes = 
- dematerialization (including OCR) 
- automatisation/robotisation (simplify process management & remove low-added value tasks)
- analysis/visualisation (taylored extracts with fancy presentation)    

A unique Opportunity to offer more responsive, available, and user-friendly finance tools

For a revamped and fancy finance
