### Chapter 5.1. Soft skills

What soft skills are required for the changing role of finance ? 
Broadly speaking, it's around communication and agility.  

Two questioning stereotypes to debate about this changing role :
- From number cruncher to story teller ?
- From stability to agility ?

### Chapter 5.2. Project Management skills

#### Waterfall & V-cycle

- Waterfall Model : linear sequential flow through the phases of project implementation.

----

- V-cycle : process steps are bent downwards & upwards with coding at the center.

*Read more: [Wiki V-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model_%28software_development%29)*

----

Typical V-cycle activitties :     
- Preparation (scope & goal setting, risk mngt, planing, budgeting, change plan)
- Functional specifications
- Detailed design / technical specifications
- Development (at the centre of the V-cycle)
- Unit testing (per module)
- Integration / SIT (System Intergation Testing)
- User Acceptance Test (UAT) 

----

#### Project Risks management

Risk = future event with negative consequences      

- Risk definition, by Impact and Probability
- Risk mitigation : 
  - Accept 
  - Reduce (implement costs to reduce impact or probability)
  - Control (proper planing to react on time) 
  - Tansfer (to another party)

#### SCRUM / Agile project management
<img src="images/scrum.jpg" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"/> 

----

- Agile/SCRUM, main diffrence with Waterfall / V-cycle:      
**The user (the client) participes to the project development cycle - no tunnel effect**    

- Agile/SCRUM, a real added value:      
**SCRUM translated informal best practices into a formal methodology : inspiring values, renamed roles and fancy ceremonies**

----

##### Agile Manifesto:

----

- USER STORIES (what the client/user wants) rather than functional specifications
- SCRUM MASTER rather than project manager  
- PRODUCT OWNER rather than client representative
- STAND-UP MEETING (no seats, 2 min each, goal oriented = what I did / what I will do / what issues) rather than weekly/daily point
- SPRINT (a set period of time during which specific tasks must be completed) rather then sub-project / set of tasks

----

- Deliverables are demo based (avoids the "almost done" syndrom)
- Retrospective and continuous improvement (what worked, what not, and what could be improved)
- And even "technical breakfast" as part of the methodology, and much more ...

### Chapter 5.3. Change Management skills

> It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.    
*Charles Darwin*

----

#### Understand the resistance to change / the change cycle

> Why Do Employees Resist Change? By HBR [here](https://hbr.org/1996/05/why-do-employees-resist-change?referral=03759&cm_vc=rr_item_page.bottom)

The greatest expectation for people is to participate to change implementation, in a co-construction mode.  

----

Change needs to be supported by two vectors : 
- Dedicated transformation teams, whether internal or external consultants (it then develops a number of techniques based on instrumental and / or agile driving)
- Management driven (managerial change management)
#### Change management has to become a daily managerial practice, in a process of tranversal co-construction

----

### Chapter 5.4. Technical / technology skills

- How much do you need to know? Broad culture ? Specific know-how ?
- A broad technical understanding shows to be usefull
- **Cherry-picking can be rewarding** (example : learning how to use Power BI for fancy dataviz, or how to configure an RPA software product to take care of low added value tasks).
