> QUOTE by Accenture (" Finance 2020 ")  

"Finance is doing things that it never could before thanks to digital technologies. End-to-end multi-dimensional data access is enabling total visibility into both enterprise and customer data. The result? The finance organization will evolve from an expense control, spreadsheet-driven accounting and reporting center, into a predictive analytics powerhouse that creates business value. Tomorrow’s digital finance organization is  a radical departure from the status quo. It deals in analytics and forward-looking decisions to create value and manage risk. It shifts traditional accounting and processing to cross-functional integrated business services models that use robotic process automation. It trades reporting the past for predicting the future."
