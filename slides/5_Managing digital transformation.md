## Chapter 5 - Managing digital transformation

----

### Key success factors for any digitalisation project

Succes holds in 3 words: tools, processes, people…   

yep, its vast!

----

- Tools : 
  - right tool for the right need : specs & thorough thinking and choice
  - adapt choice complexity to stake at hand
  - ever though you got the wrong tool ? 
- Processes : 
  - are they clear over the whole process (example over different countries, different BUs / teams) ?
  - are they precises enough (avoid regular human intervention to clarifiy process) ? 
  - a good opportunity to clarify !
- People: right team, right support (change management), right support (politics)
 - right roles & responsibilites, right time allocation, right individual skills (and innovation spirit & mindset)
 - change management : provide right support, communication & training (are "they" ready for this?), ensure capacity to drive change if in the driver seat
 - stakeholders management : align interests at all levels & deal with politics (internal conflicts) 

----

### Global or local ?  

- Global digital strategy (look at Michelin) 
- or Short steps & initiatives / quickwinns (la politique des petits pas in French) 
- Top down or bottom up methodology ?
- Proactive or resisting management ?

Well it all works. But not with the same paste / scale / pleasure !

----
### Global : a claer vision & plan

1. Strategic vision : where we want to go 
(What does digital transformation mean for the company? How much of a transformation do we want to make?)
- Build a vision of a target state (objectives and impact)
- A clearly stated vision helps align everyone’s actions

2. Engage stakeholders
- Ensure everyone understands the why
- Leadership vision secures support and buy-in from stakeholders (board, executives, employees, partners and customers)

3. Define a proper planning associated to the strategic vision
- Plan includes relatively clear tasks and milestones
- Including quickwins to boost motivation 

4. Ensure sufficient resources and expertise
- Internal team that has the right knowledge and authority, external support, training…

### Local initiatives

A large source of Digital inspiration !

Local iniitiatives are everywhere (with ou wthout a Global strategy) 

> Managing signature books (parapheurs in French) 

----

### WIIFM (What's in there for me) ? 

- A hobby, a side-duty, a full time job ?

- How is it considered within the organisation ?
- Does it create value to the Finance team ?

- Does it create value to my profile ?
- Is there anything about fun in this approach ?

----

### Managing finance digital transformation : what is at stake for finance function ? 

- Keeping the company up-to-speed ?
- Re-inventing a more "sexy" and business oriented Corporate finance ? 
- Having Finance to become the digital leader or to loose its central role on numbers (as digital remove silos, who is going to lead soon, Finance, IT, or Marketing) ?
