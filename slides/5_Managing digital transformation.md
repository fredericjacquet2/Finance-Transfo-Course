## Chapter 5 - Managing digital transformation

----

### Key success factors

Succes holds in 3 words: tools, processes, people…   

yep, its vast!

----

- Tools : ever though you got the wrong tool ?
- Processes : are they really clear ? Ask the one whose handling those ... A good opportunity to clarify !
- People: roles & responsibilites, innovation spirit & mindset, right individual skills and training, politics and stakeholders management, change management...

----

### Global or local ?  

- Global digital strategy (look at Michelin) 
- or Short steps & initiatives / quickwinns (la politique des petits pas in French) 
- Top down or bottom up methodology ?
- Proactive or resisting management ?

Well it all works. But not with the same paste / scale / pleasure !

----
### Global : a claer vision & plan

1. Strategic vision : where we want to go 
(What does digital transformation mean for the company? How much of a transformation do we want to make?)
- Build a vision of a target state (objectives and impact)
- A clearly stated vision helps align everyone’s actions

2. Engage stakeholders
- Ensure everyone understands the why
- Leadership vision secures support and buy-in from stakeholders (board, executives, employees, partners and customers)

3. Define a proper planning associated to the strategic vision
- Plan includes relatively clear tasks and milestones
- Including quickwins to boost motivation 

4. Ensure sufficient resources and expertise
- Internal team that has the right knowledge and authority, external support, training…

- How is it considered within the organisation ?
- Does it create value to the Finance team ?

- Does it create value to my profile ?
- Is there anything about fun in this approach ?

----

### Managing finance digital transformation : what is at stake for finance function ? 

- Keeping the company up-to-speed ?
- Re-inventing a more "sexy" and business oriented Corporate finance ? 
- Having Finance to become the digital leader or to loose its central role on numbers (as digital remove silos, who is going to lead soon, Finance, IT, or Marketing) ?
