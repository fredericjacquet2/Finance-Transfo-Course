### Key success factors for any digitalisation project

Succes holds in 3 words: people, processes, tools   

yep, its vast!

----

- PEOPLE     
 - Right team, right support (change management), right support (politics)
 - Right roles & responsibilites, right time allocation, right individual skills and mindset
 - Change management : provide right support, communication & training (are "they" ready for this?), ensure capacity to drive change if in the driver seat
 - Stakeholders management : align interests at all levels & deal with politics (internal conflicts) 

----

- PROCESSES 
  - Are they clear over the whole process (different countries, BUs, teams) ?
  - Are they precise enough (avoid regular human intervention to clarifiy process) ? 
  - A good opportunity to clarify !


- TOOLS
  - Avoid "tool first" approach
  - Right tool for the right need : specs, thorough thinking and choice
  - Adapt choice complexity to stake at hand
  - Did you ever thought you got the wrong tool ?     

----

### Global or local ?  

- Global digital strategy (look at Michelin) 
- or Short steps / local initiatives / quickwinns 
- Top down or bottom up methodology ?
- Proactive or resisting management ?

Well it all works. But not with the same paste / scale / pleasure !

----

### Global : a claer vision & plan

###### Strategic vision (where we want to go) 
- Build a vision of a target state (objectives and impact) : a clearly stated vision helps align everyone’s actions

###### Engage stakeholders    
- Ensure everyone understands the why. Leadership vision secures support and buy-in from stakeholders (board, executives, employees, partners and customers)

###### Proper planning     
- Plan includes relatively clear tasks and milestones, including quickwins to boost motivation 

###### Sufficient resources and expertise    
- Internal team with right knowledge, authority, external support

### Local initiatives

A large source of Digital inspiration !

Local initiatives are everywhere (with or without a Global strategy) 

> Case example : Managing signature books (parapheurs in French) in a large European group     

- Set-up Docusing software as an internal tool to replace "physical" signature books process   
- Result : improved treasury management / on-time payments

### Managing finance digital transformation : what is at stake for the finance function ? 

- Keeping the company up-to-speed ?
- Re-inventing a more "sexy" and business oriented Corporate finance ? 
- Having Finance to become the digital leader or to loose its central role on numbers ? 
- As digital remove silos, could there be a competition between Finance, IT and Marketing to become the leading funciton of the company? [see video : vision of 2 predicitve scenarios by Deloitte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hU2zyRKKZ5g)
#### Finance evolution = « business partner » or Expert ? An existential challenge ?  

----

### WIIFM (What's in it for me) ? 

- Is my job/role impacted by those initaitves ? Good or bad news ?
- How is digital considered within the organisation ? Does it create value to the Finance team ?
- Does it create value to my personal profile ? Do I have a personal interest in this field (tech addict, change, new, fun...)?    

#### An annoyance or a hobby, a side-duty or a full time job ?
