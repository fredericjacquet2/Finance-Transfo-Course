### 5. Chatbots (WIP)

- Chatbot = a talking robot (imitates human conversations through voice and/or text chats).    
- Chatbot minimizes response time & improves customer experience.    

*History of chatbots dates back to 1966 whit a psychotherapist called ELIZA. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend).*

Very broad complexity of chatbots, two variants
- Rule-Based : bot answers questions based on defined and set rules (rules can be simple to complex!)
- Self learning: bot uses Machine Learning-based approaches. More efficient than rule-based bots.
