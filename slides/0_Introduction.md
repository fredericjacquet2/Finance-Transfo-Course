### What is Digital ?

- Loads of definitions !    

- A matter of perception   

- My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   

Social media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), Cloud = the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to the business  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.
