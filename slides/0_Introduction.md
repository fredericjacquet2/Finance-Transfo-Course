2. The BPF (Business Partner Finance) leverages its contribution with big data & analytics, and gets into **predictive performance management**.  

3. By embracing a panel of technology solutions, and developing appropriate skills, Finance builds the know-how to **lead the company’s Digital transformation**.

### 2. What is Digital ?

- Loads of definitions !    

- A matter of perception   

- My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   

Social media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), Cloud    
= the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to the business  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.

- But definitlely the fastest one humanity ever faced   
- From change to agility
