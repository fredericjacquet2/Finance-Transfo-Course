### 1. What is Digital ?

- Loads of definitions ! A matter of perception   

- My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   

Social media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), Cloud    
= the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to the business  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.

#### Is Digital such a revolution ? 

- Yes it is !  
- Not the first drastic lifestyle revolution (think of agriculture & industrial revolutions !)  
- But definitlely the fastest one humanity ever faced   
- From change to agility

### 2. What is the Corporate Finance function ?

- What is its role ?
- How is it usually organised ?
- Which processes does it manage ?

----

The classical agenda :

- Optimising cash and financing

----

The new agenda / latest trends :

- Cash culture / cash is king
- CSC shared Service Centers : externalisation, mutualisation, efficiency

The new agenda / latest trends :

- Becoming a business partner (strategy / M&A / FP&A). From cost control to business analysis, transforming finance from a cost center to a profit center   
- Dealing with new compliance requirements (GDPR, compliance...) : from expertise to training and IT management
- Cash culture / cash is king (cash pooling & working cap optimization)
- CSC (shared Service Centers) : externalisation for greater mutualisation & efficiency (objectives, scope & distance, process, ROI, change)
- Managing organisaitonal & technological process transformation     

Well those ar eall very much linked to digital !
**What are non-digital Finance Transformation issues (the ones excluded from this course) ?** 

- Dealing with new regulatory / compliance requirements (GDPR...)

- Shifting Finance towards a business partner mindset. "Our controllers may understand the figures but not what it takes to improve them". Shifting from viewing finance as a cost center to seeing it as a profit center.      

- Cash is King / cash improvement initiatives

- Implementing SSC (Shared Services Centers)    

Well, those are very much related to digital as well !
