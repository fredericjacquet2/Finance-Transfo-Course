In this chapter

1. What is Digital ?

3. Course presentation (objectives & course plan)

----

### 1. What is Digital ?

- Loads of definitions ! A matter of perception   

- My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   

Social media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), Cloud    
= the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to the business  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.

#### Is Digital such a revolution ? 

- Yes it is !  
- Not the first drastic lifestyle revolution (think of agriculture & industrial revolutions !)  
- But definitlely the fastest one humanity ever faced   
- From change to agility

----

----

The classical agenda : 
- Ensuring quality and conformity of financial information
- Calculating costs and profitability of activtities
- Optimising cash and financing

----

The new agenda / latest trends :

- Becoming a business partner : strategy / M&A / FP&A. From cost control to business analysis, finance as profit center rather then cost center ("our controllers may understand the figures but not what it takes to improve them")
- Dealing with new compliance requirements (GDPR, compliance...) : from expertise to training and IT management

Optimiser la trésorerie (cash is king) : centralisation tréso (cash pooling), chantiers d'optimisation du BFR
Externalisation par mise en oeuvre de CSP Centres de Services Partagés : mutualisation - efficience par l'externalisation (objectifs et enjeux, choix de périmètre et d'éloignement, process, ROI, chantier Change)
Mener la transformation organisationnelle et technologique des processus
Tous ces enjeux sont fortement liés au digital !

----
### 3. Course presentation (objectives, plan and story)

----

#### Course objectives  

Provide an overview of a fuzzy subject !   

- Corporate finance digitalisation implementations, means & required skills
- Understand the changing role of Corporte finance

- The course excludes non-digital Corporate Finance Transfo isues

----

**What are non-digital Finance Transformation issues (the ones excluded from this course) ?** 

- Dealing with new regulatory / compliance requirements (GDPR...)

- Shifting Finance towards a business partner mindset. "Our controllers may understand the figures but not what it takes to improve them". Shifting from viewing finance as a cost center to seeing it as a profit center.      

- Cash is King / cash improvement initiatives

- Implementing SSC (Shared Services Centers)    

Well, those are very much related to digital as well !   

----

#### Course plan (if on PC, press ESC)  
- Chapter 1 = Introduction (course, digital and corporate finance presentation)

- Chapter 3 = Leveraging the "business partner finance" with Big data & Analytics
- Chapter 4 = Technology & solutions
