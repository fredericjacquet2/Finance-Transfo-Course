### What is Digital ?
Loads of definitions !    
A matter of perception   
My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   
Social Media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), and Cloud, the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to businesses  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime, real-time)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives. 

----
### Is Digital such a revolution ? 
Yes it is !  
Not the first drastic lifestyle revolution (agriculture & inductrial revoltions)  
But definitlely the fastest one humanity ever faced   
From change to agility
