### What is Digital ?
Loads of definitions ! 
A matter ofperception
My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC
SMAC for Social Media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), and Cloud, the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to businesses
- Social media widens the scope of communication (social engagement, professional networks, customer connections...)
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables fast and efficient communication and greater accessibility to information
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze the Big Data generated from various sources.
- Cloud removes physinal barriers and helps in storing and accessing information.
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.
