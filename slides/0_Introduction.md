### The User Story

By digitalizing the finance processes (dematerialization - automation/robotization - visualization), the Corporate Finance function improves its quality of service and moves towards a user-friendly and effective service provider to the business. 

Digitalizing finance processes also provides more room for analysis, thus better positioning the Finance function as a partner at the service of the business. This BPF (Business Partner Finance) is leveraging its contribution with digital solutions (BI, EPM). He is getting into predictive performance management with Big Data & Analytics and thus becomes the master of the Data.

By embracing a panel of Digital technology solutions (vendor-embedded, RPA, IA, Blockchain), and developing the skills and competencies to manage Digital disruption, Finance builds a know-how on managing digital transformation, and is though becoming the company’s engine of Digital transformation.
