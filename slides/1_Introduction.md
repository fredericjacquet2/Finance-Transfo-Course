3. Course presentation

### Chapter 1.1. What is Digital ?

- Loads of definitions ! A matter of perception   

- My prefered definition = technologies, business models and usages driven by intersection of SMAC   

Social media, Mobility, Analytics (big data), Cloud    
= the 4 pilars of Digital

----

Each SMAC component offers specific services to the business  
- Social media widens the scope of communication and information 
- Mobile connectivity (smartphones and tablets) enables accessibility (anywhere, anytime)
- Analytics provides opportunities to analyze Big Data  
- Cloud removes physinal barriers for storing and accessing information  
These four independent technologies combine to form a number of solutions changing our daily lives.

#### Is Digital such a revolution ? 

- Yes it is! Not the first drastic lifestyle revolution (think of agriculture & industrial revolutions !)  
- But definitlely the fastest one humanity ever faced   
- From change to agility

### Chapter 1.2. What is the Corporate Finance function ?

- What is its role ?
- How is it usually organised ?
- Which processes does it manage ?

----

The classical agenda : 
- Ensuring quality and conformity of financial information
- Calculating costs and profitability of activtities
- Optimising cash and financing

----

The new agenda / latest trends :

- Becoming a business partner (strategy / M&A / FP&A biz analysis)   
- Dealing with new regulatory / compliance requirements
- Cash culture / cash is king
- CSC shared Service Centers : externalisation, mutualisation, efficiency
- Managing organisational & technological process transformation
